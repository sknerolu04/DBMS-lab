## Table Structures and Outputs

### `FLIGHT` Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE FLIGHT(
    FLIGHT_NUM INT,
    SOURCE VARCHAR(20),
    DESTINATION VARCHAR(20),
    DISTANCE INT,
    DEPARTS VARCHAR(10),
    ARRIVES VARCHAR(10),
    PRICE INT,
    PRIMARY KEY(FLIGHT_NUM)
);
```

#### Inserting Data into `FLIGHT`:

```sql
INSERT INTO FLIGHT VALUES(1,'BANGALORE','MANGALORE',300,'10:45','12:00', 10000);
INSERT INTO FLIGHT VALUES(2,'BANGALORE','DELHI',5000,'12:15','4:30', 25000);
INSERT INTO FLIGHT VALUES(3,'BANGALORE','MUMBAI',3500,'2:15','5:25', 30000);
INSERT INTO FLIGHT VALUES(4,'DELHI','MUMBAI',4500,'10:15','12:05', 35000);
INSERT INTO FLIGHT VALUES(5,'DELHI','FRANKFURT',18000,'7:15','5:30', 90000);
INSERT INTO FLIGHT VALUES(6,'BANGALORE','FRANKFURT',19500,'10:00','7:45', 95000);
INSERT INTO FLIGHT VALUES(7,'BANGALORE','FRANKFURT',17000,'12:00','6:30', 99000);
```

**Output** after insertion:

## SQL Queries and Expected Output

### Query 1

List aircraft names for employees who earn more than 80,000 and are certified to fly certain aircraft.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT a.aname 
FROM aircraft a, certified b, employees e
WHERE b.aid = a.aid
AND c.eid = a.eid
AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT *
                FROM employees e1
                WHERE e.eid = e.eid
                AND e.salary < 80000);
```

**Expected Output**:

| ANAME      |
|------------|
| BOEING     |
| AIRBUS380  |
| JET01      |
| AIRBUS     |

---

### Query 2

Find the employee IDs and the maximum cruising range of aircraft they are certified for, but only for employees who are certified to fly more than three aircraft.

```sql
SELECT c.eid, MAX(cruisingrange)
FROM certified c, aircraft a
WHERE a.aid = b.aid
GROUP BY a.eid
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3;
```

**Expected Output**:

| EID | MAX(CRUISINGRANGE) |
|-----|--------------------|
| 1   | 8000               |

---

### Query 3

List employee names who earn less than or equal to the minimum flight price for flights from Bangalore to Mumbai.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT e.ename 
FROM employees e 
WHERE e.salary <= (SELECT MIN(f.price)
                    FROM flight f
                    WHERE f.source = 'BANGALORE'
                    AND f.destination = 'MUMBAI');
```

**Expected Output**:

| ENAME |
|-------|
| AJAY  |

---

### Query 4

Find aircraft IDs with a cruising range higher than the minimum flight distance from Bangalore to Delhi.

```sql
SELECT e.aid
FROM aircraft a 
WHERE a.cruisingrange > (SELECT MIN(f.distance)
                        FROM flight f1 
                        WHERE f1.source = 'BANGALORE'
                        AND f1.destination = 'DELHI');
```

**Expected Output**:

| AID  |
|------|
| 302  |
| 306  |
| 378  |

---

### Query 5

List the employee names and salaries who earn the maximum salary, which is greater than the second-highest salary.

```sql
SELECT ename, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary = (SELECT MAX(salary)
                FROM employees
                WHERE salary > (SELECT MAX(salary)
                                FROM employees));
```

**Expected Output**:

| ENAME | SALARY  |
|-------|---------|
| RAM   | 100000  |
